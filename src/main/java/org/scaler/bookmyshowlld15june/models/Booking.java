//ORM :
//O : Object R Relation M Mapping
//Hibernate

//PhonePe
//PhonePe -> yesBank
//SpringBoot -> Hibernate
//JPA
//PhonePe -> BankApi <- YesBank
//SB -> JPA <- Hibernate

//- To ensure Proper contracts are there. Spring Data JPA is the interface for all SQL
// DB’s.
//- Basically why JPA is there so Other ORM’s don’t change the Syntax as per their Choice.
//        - Hibernate has to follow JPA contracts.
//        - Spring Data JPA → is an interface which contains methods which are
//        implemented by Hibernate.

// How will the ORM know which table to create?
